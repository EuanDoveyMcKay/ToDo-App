The idea behind this project is a VERY minimalistic To Do app for a mobile phone that keeps things simple whilst being a little more specialised than a random notes app on ones phone...
I know apps exist for this already, but this one would be cool to have for personl use, cuz I can make it exactly as I need it ^_^

I will probably end up discarding this project, as with all others, but that's the future. For now Imma just code what I feel like doing.

I have a piece of paper with my ideas on, so here's a bried overview...
Tasks will be in their own little curved boxes, with three vertical lists (a menu for each one) which are "active", "done", "archived".
The "done list" will only ever contain 10 things, and the anything beyond the 10 most recent will be deleted for storage reasons.
